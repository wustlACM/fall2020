# Hello there

Welcome to the dev/deploy repo for ACM Fall 2020 Activities Fair site!

Firstly, a warm welcome to all Freshman and returning students! We live in exceptional times and our new mode of study may not be what we all envisioned university life to be. Rest assured there will be lots of fun and engaging (virtual) activities planned for the semester to keep you entertained and engaged in learning throughout the semester!

Cheers,
*also, if you're here,* **we want you** *\*points finger\* to be part of our web dev team!*
